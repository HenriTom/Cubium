# üåê Cubium ‚Äì The In-Game Minecraft Browser  

**Cubium** is a client-side Minecraft mod that integrates a Chromium-based browser directly into the game. With Cubium, you can browse the web seamlessly without ever needing to tab out. The browser can be opened at any time using the **B** key (default, customizable in settings).

## üö® Important  

Cubium uses the [MCEF library](https://modrinth.com/mod/mcef). Make sure to install it together with the mod.

You will also need the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and the [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin) for the mod to work.

If you want to use Quilt, you'll need to use the [Quilted Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl) instead of the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api), and the [Quilt Kotlin Libraries](https://modrinth.com/mod/qkl) instead of the [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin).

## üõ†Ô∏è Features  

- **Fully Integrated Browser:** Surf the web while staying in Minecraft.  
- **Customizable Search Engines:** Choose your preferred search engine for a optimized browsing experience.  
- **Picture-in-Picture Mode:** Use a floating, movable window to browse while playing.
- **Minimizable Window:** Minimize the browser while keeping audio and processes active.
- **File Downloads:** Download files directly through the browser without leaving Minecraft.
- **Client-Side Only:** No server-side dependencies; works in any singleplayer or multiplayer environment.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use, just like a regular browser.  

## üöÄ How to Use  

1. Press **B** (default) to open the browser in-game.  
2. **First Time Setup**: Select your preferred search engine; the browser will open once you've made your selection.
3. After selection, pressing **B** will open the browser directly with your chosen search engine.  
4. If you haven't closed Minecraft, Cubium will remember your **last visited page** instead.  
5. To reset your search engine (if you want to change it), use the command:  
    **/cubium reset_default_se**

## üß© Works Great with TMYK
Cubium works seamlessly with the [TMYK](https://modrinth.com/plugin/tmyk) mod by fingerguns83. TMYK allows you to easily access wiki links by typing **/wiki [search term]**, or simply **/wiki** to look up information about blocks, entities, or fluids you're currently looking at.
